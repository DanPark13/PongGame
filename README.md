# Pong Game: My First Project into Game Development

After getting used to block programming, I decided to go off-book and start to make my own projects.

I decided to make a video game called *El Clasico Shots* a video game that is based on one of my favorite Flash games at that time: Goalkeeper Premier!

I also decided that I would add a Kicker phase too, unlike the Goalkeeper Premier game where you couldn't play as the striker.

This was also the first app I planned on releasing to the Google Play Store (although I couldn't when I realized I had to pay money for a developer's account) 

This was the title screen with a basic UI that came with catchy music in the background!
